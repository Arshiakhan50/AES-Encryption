This project provides an implementation of the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption algorithm in Java. AES is a widely used encryption standard known for its strong security features. This implementation showcases the encryption and decryption process using the AES algorithm.

    #Exploring the Code:

    Open the AES_Algo.java file in a Java development environment, such as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. You'll find the code organized into different components:
        KeyGen: This component generates the round keys required for the AES algorithm.
        Conversion: It provides utilities to convert between different data formats.
        Encryption: Handles the AES encryption process.
        Decryption: Manages the AES decryption process.

    Setting Up Key and Message:
        Uncomment the key and message variables in the main method. These variables should contain the encryption key and the message you want to encrypt and then decrypt.
        Replace the placeholders with the actual key and message you want to use for the demonstration.

    Observing the Output:
        The program will print the original message, the encrypted message, and the decrypted message.
        You'll see how the KeyGen, Conversion, Encryption, and Decryption components work together to secure the message.
